# DartboardOS

DartboardOS is a project using python 3, kivy and sqlite to create a game scoreboard and stats database for darts.

The code is written specifically to run on the official Raspberry Pi 7" touch screen, but will work fine on a laptop screen, as the app window will auto-size on opening.
